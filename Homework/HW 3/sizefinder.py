def size_rank(chest_measurement, increase, min_chest):
    '''
        Function -- size_rank
            Represents the level of chest measurement in a size chart in
            proportional form.
        Parameter:
            chest_measurement -- The chest measurement
            increase -- The consistent difference in inches between two
            adjacent sizes in a size chart.
            min_chest -- The minimum inches of chest in a size chart. 
        Returns:
            The level of chest measurement in size charts in proportional form.
